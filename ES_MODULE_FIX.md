# ðŸ”§ ES Module Issue - FIXED! 

## What Was Wrong
The app was failing to launch with this error:
```
ReferenceError: require is not defined in ES module scope
```

## The Problem
- Your `package.json` has `"type": "module"` (needed for React/Vite)
- This makes ALL `.js` files be treated as ES modules
- But Electron's main process was written in CommonJS syntax (`require()`)
- This created a conflict between the two module systems

## The Solution âœ…
1. **Renamed Electron files to `.cjs` extension**:
   - `electron/main.js` â†’ `electron/main.cjs`
   - `electron/preload.js` â†’ `electron/preload.cjs`
   
2. **Updated package.json**:
   - `"main": "electron/main.cjs"`
   
3. **Updated preload path reference**:
   - Changed to `preload.cjs` in main file

4. **Added code signing disable to scripts**:
   - All build commands now use `CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false`

## Result ðŸŽ‰
- **App now launches successfully** âœ…
- **No more ES module errors** âœ…  
- **Double-click to run works** âœ…
- **All functionality preserved** âœ…

## Technical Details
- `.cjs` extension forces CommonJS mode even with `"type": "module"`
- React app continues to use ES modules as intended
- Electron process uses CommonJS as intended
- Both coexist peacefully in the same project

Your standalone app is now fully working and ready to use!
